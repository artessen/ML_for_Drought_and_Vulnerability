# ML_for_Drought_and_Vulnerability
This repository contains a set of scripts to train a tree-based model for performing a vulnerability assessment of households in a country to droughts.

## Data

- Household data: high quality household budget survey data (the Household Expenditure and Income Survey - HEIS) on an annual basis for Iran is collected from the publicly available website of the country's statistical agency. Importantly, the data constains information on consumption variables (e.g. “pcer” and “pcer_17”) and poverty line values (e.g. "pline685"). 
- Geospatial data: 

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is two-fold: 
- first, to train a model capable of accurately classifying a household as under or above a certain poverty line value, and; 
- secondly, to understand if any relationship (in terms of correlation) exists between the input household, climate and drought-related and the objective poverty datasets. 

Building on the hypothesis that a model that can achieve both objectives i) and ii), we explore the utilization of a decision tree-based model to predict the probability of a consumption variable (e.g. “pcer” and “pcer_17”) to be above or below the poverty line (e.g. “pline685”).
