# ML_for_Drought_and_Vulnerability
This repository contains a set of scripts to train a tree-based model for performing a vulnerability assessment of households in a country to droughts.

## Data

- Household data: high quality household budget survey data (the Household Expenditure and Income Survey - HEIS) on an annual basis for Iran is collected from the publicly available website of the country's statistical agency. Importantly, the data constains information on consumption variables (e.g. “pcer” and “pcer_17”) and poverty line values (e.g. "pline685"). 
- Geospatial data: different climate and drought-related data is collected from different sources in order to capture the drought hazard dynamics in the selected country (i.e. Iran). The collected climate and drought-related data is extracted at the ADM2 level and provided as monthly mean aggregates covering the period between 2011-2020. Climate-related variables are collected from the ERA5-Land dataset and include both temperature and precipitation data. Drought-related variables are collected from different sources to help categorizing drought events as meteorological, hydrological, or aricultural droughts. Drought-variables include the Agricultural Stress Index (ASI) provided by the Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) provided by CRU_ts4.06, the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) provided by the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC), and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) provided by the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI). 

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is two-fold: 
- first, to train a model capable of accurately classifying a household as under or above a certain poverty line value, and; 
- secondly, to understand if any relationship (in terms of correlation) exists between the input household, climate and drought-related and the objective poverty datasets. 

Building on the hypothesis that a model that can achieve both objectives i) and ii), we explore the utilization of a decision tree-based model to predict the probability of a consumption variable (e.g. “pcer” and “pcer_17”) to be above or below the poverty line (e.g. “pline685”).
